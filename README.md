💧 Water Footprint Analyzer — SIH Project
A Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project that identifies agricultural products from images and displays their estimated water footprint, aiming to promote sustainable farming practices and water conservation.

🚀 Features
🌾 Object Detection of agricultural produce using TensorFlow.js

💦 Water Footprint Calculator for each recognized item

✅ Yes/No Feedback System to verify accuracy and update the dataset

🧠 AI Recommendations for farmers when water usage is high

📦 Easy integration with frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

🌐 Offline-capable (can work without internet if deployed as a PWA)

🧠 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

ML Library: TensorFlow.js (for in-browser object detection)

Data Handling: JSON for storing and updating water footprint values

Optional Backend (Future Scope): Node.js / Firebase / MongoDB

⚙️ How It Works
User uploads or captures an image.

The model detects the agricultural product in the image.

Water footprint of the product is displayed.

User confirms detection via Yes/No:

Yes: Retrieves or confirms existing water data.

No: Prompts to add new data or re-label the image.

🌱 Use Case
Designed for farmers, agricultural officers, and sustainability researchers to:

Make informed crop decisions based on water usage.

Educate users about high water-demand crops.

Encourage efficient water resource management.

📈 Future Enhancements
Add Google Maps API to recommend alternate crops based on region.

Database integration for dynamic updates and analytics.

Multi-language support for broader accessibility.

Support for live camera feed object detection.
